✨ FULL PAGE LAYOUT BLUEPRINT

Imagine the page flowing vertically like a story.

SECTION 1 — Landing / Emotional Hook

(Full screen height if possible)

Content:

Large Text:

Hi babi 🤍

Small Text under it:

This little page is only for you.

Spacing:

• Big gap between lines
• Everything centered vertically & horizontally

Animation:

✔ Entire section fades in slowly
✔ Optional ultra-subtle floating text

Purpose: immediate softness & intimacy.

SECTION 2 — Gentle Build-Up

After scroll ↓

Text block:

I didn’t want to just send a message.
You deserve something more personal.

Style:

• Medium font size
• Soft color (white or gentle gray)

Animation:

✔ Fade up / slide up
✔ Slow timing

Keep LOTS of white space.

SECTION 3 — Handwritten Letter (Main Focus)

Centered image.

Layout:

[ Letter Image ]
[ Small Caption ]

Caption example:

Every word here is sincere.

Design tips:

✔ Image not too large
✔ Rounded corners (very nice with pink theme)
✔ Soft shadow (very subtle)

Animation:

✔ Soft fade-in OR slight zoom-in

This is your emotional core — keep it visually calm.

SECTION 4 — Emotional Micro-Lines

Minimal but powerful.

Example:

No excuses.
Only honesty.
Only you.

Spacing:

• Each line separated nicely
• Do NOT crowd text

Animation (important trick):

✔ Each line fades in individually as she scrolls

This feels very cinematic and emotional.

SECTION 5 — Warm Reassurance

Single short line:

You are deeply important to me, babi.

OR

Distance never changed how much you mean to me.

Layout:

✔ Centered
✔ Slightly larger than body text

Animation:

✔ Soft fade-in

SECTION 6 — Button Moment (Very Important)

Lots of breathing room before button.

Button text (best choice):

Babi… one more thing.

Button style:

✔ Rounded edges
✔ Soft darker pink than background
✔ White text
✔ Clean & minimal

Animation:

✔ Fade-in
✔ Optional slow gentle pulse

This is your emotional “pause”.

SECTION 7 — Hidden Message Reveal

Appears AFTER click.

Layout:

Soft text block, centered.

Suggested wording:

Babi,
There’s something I’ve been wanting to send you — something small, but filled with love.

If you’re comfortable sharing it with me, may I know the address where I can send my little surprise?

No pressure… I just wanted to ask you this in a special way.

Animation:

✔ Fade-in
✔ Smooth reveal (no sudden pop)

Tone = affectionate, gentle, safe.

🎨 SPACING GUIDE (Secret Sauce)

Each section should feel like it has air.

Rule of thumb:

✔ More space than you think you need
✔ Avoid clutter at ALL costs
✔ Romantic pages breathe

✨ PERFECT ANIMATION TYPES

Use ONLY:

✔ Fade In
✔ Fade Up
✔ Slow transitions
✔ Ease-in-out timing

Avoid:

✘ Bounce
✘ Spin
✘ Flip
✘ Fast motion

Soft emotions = soft motion.

💗 FONT PAIRING (Very good with pink)

Elegant romantic combo:

Headings → Playfair Display
Body → Poppins

If you want modern-cute only:

Everything → Poppins
